## Overview

An ```Operation``` is an adaptation of the [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) that knows how to revert executed commands, so that
artifacts are not left behind after the test is complete.

For testing, this is a extremely useful pattern.  This library provides a proven
and tested framework to use as a base for writing integration tests in your projects.


## Try it out

It's easy to get started adding operations to your Java project.  Just add to your ```<dependencies>``` section:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.vmware.test-operations</groupId>
  <artifactId>test-operations</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Then implement your own class implementing an Operation.  Examples are in the project.

## Why do I want this?

Operations are a powerful pattern for building integration tests that need to clean up after themselves.  They
encourage well-written tests and have the following benefits:

### Independent, reusable blocks
Operations encourage test functionality to be designed as a collection of reusable blocks.  Each operation
is responsible for implementing one specific behavior, usually around a complex behavior or an allocated resource.
All of the code around creating, deleting, and validation of that resource is kept in a single object.

Test scenarios are then built up from these composable blocks, and then behavior is confirmed.  Operations are also a convenient place for helper methods that perform additional verifications or extract information about the created resources.

### Cleaning up
Operations, like [Commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern), encapsulate code that should
be executed to create or reserve a resource.

Additionally they can "revert" the creation or reservation, to put the environment in the state it was before the test ran.

Once the tests are complete (successful or not), the operations need to clean up any allocated or reserved resources.

Operations treat this as a special mode, and ensure the following are true:
1. cleanup is always run
2. cleanup is best effort and resources may not be released (because of #1), and
3. errors are suppressed (so as to not interfere with the actual test results)

### Composable
Groups of operations can be treated as operations themselves.

The simplest composition is just a sequence of operations treated as a single
operation.  This is the
mechanism commonly used in every test, so that after its execution, the combined
sequence of operations is cleaned up in the opposite order.

But we can also group operations in a parallel list.  Lists are executed concurrently
(using a ExecutorService instance), which makes testing on multiple threads for
concurrency extremely easy.

By combining the two, complex structures can be setup and torn down very quickly to
decrease the running times of tricky integration tests.  See
[OperationCollections](DOCUMENTATION.md#OperationCollections) for more details.

### Built-in validation
Operations understand validations as a first-class helper object.
By default, validations are run after the successful execution or reversion of an
operation.

This encourages every operation to be validated in every test, without
test writers having to duplicate basic validations and assertions.

For special situations, the validation list is mutable -- default validations can be
removed and additional validations can be added easily.

Because validations are done separately, they are convenient when a single generic operation
needs validation in different scenarios.  An example would a generic "create" operation that
needs to validate against both AWS and vSphere depending on the input.  With validations, the
operation code is shared, and the validation code can be specific.
